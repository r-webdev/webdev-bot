CSS can be tricky to get right, especially with the various browsers and their quirks. Here are some common issues and solutions:
1. **Box Model Issues**: Ensure you understand the CSS box model (content, padding, border, margin). Use `box-sizing: border-box;` to make width and height include padding and border.
2. **Specificity Problems**: If your styles aren't applying, check the specificity of your selectors. More specific selectors override less specific ones.
3. **Flexbox and Grid Layouts**: These modern layout systems can be complex. Make sure to understand their properties and how they interact.
