It would be much easier to help you if we could see (parts) of your code! Try reproducing your issue on one of these sites, save and then link it here:

- <https://codepen.io/> - requires account
- <https://codesandbox.io/>
- <https://repl.it/>
- <https://ideone.com/>
- <https://jsfiddle.net/>

Sometimes trying to recreate a problem outside of your project already helps you track down the issue on your own.
