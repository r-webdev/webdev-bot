Did you know you can add syntax highlighting to code blocks in markdown? Just add the language name after the opening triple backticks. For example:

> \`\`\`js
> console.log('Hello, world!');
> \`\`\`

This will render as:

```js
console.log('Hello, world!');
```

You can replace \`js\` with other languages too, e.g. \`php\`, \`css\`, \`html\`, \`ts\`, \`md\`, \`sql\`, etc.
