description: Disallow accessing .env* files; use env.ts as the single source of truth for environment configuration
---

# Environment access policy

- Do not open, read, or reference any files matching:
  - `.env`
  - `.env.*`
  - `.env*`
- Treat `src/env.ts` as the only allowed source of environment configuration. Use it whenever environment info is required.
- If a needed value appears only in a `.env*` file, stop and ask to add it to `src/env.ts` instead of reading the `.env*` file.

Reference: [env.ts](mdc:src/env.ts)
